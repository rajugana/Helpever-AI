# Project Title # Helpever-AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Describe briefly in 2-3 sentences what your project is about. About 250 characters is a nice length! 
To develop AI based tool to help people in need

## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1 - To develop AI based tool for blood donation
* problem 2 - Using AI matching blood donors with needy for emergency.
* etc.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

During Emergency health requirement like Surgery people desperately look for Blood donors - an AI based tool would help to match the requirement / donor / bloodbank / hospital- shortest possible time to get the blood.

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blood_donation_(test_tubes).JPG" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['India']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   
   donors = [1000]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(donors)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
